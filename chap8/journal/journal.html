        Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
        <ol>
            <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
            <li>Magic City, ID</li>
            <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
            <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
            <li>Why, AZ </li>
            <li>Truth or Consequences, NM.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <P>
        I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
        <blockquote>
        passing cars,<br>
        when you can't see,<br>
        May get you,<br>
        A glimpse, of eternity.<br>
        </blockquote>
        I definitely won't be passing any cars.
    </P>

        My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm
        on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
        <ul>
        <li>cell phone</li>
        <li>ipod</li>
        <li>digital camera</li>
        <li>and a protein bar</li>
        </ul>
        Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>a journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
